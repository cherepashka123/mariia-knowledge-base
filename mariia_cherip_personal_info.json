      "problem": "Clara and I would spend hours searching for specific fashion items online, only to find nothing remotely similar to what we were looking for. Despite recent developments, search engines like Google still prioritize sponsored brands and items over genuinely tailored fashion recommendations based on user intent.",
      "solution_approach": "We recognized that with the emergence of powerful AI tools, we could build a solution that truly understands shopper intent. We started by conducting discovery with 50+ NYC boutiques to understand their pain points - they had beautiful inventory but struggled with discoverability.",
      "technical_decision": "We chose multimodal embeddings and vector retrieval because we needed to translate natural language queries (like 'flowy summer dress with floral pattern') into actual in-stock products. This required understanding both text descriptions and visual features of garments.",
      "challenges": "The biggest challenge was integrating with different POS systems. We discovered that boutiques use either Square or Shopify, and each has different APIs and data structures. We had to design our system to be flexible enough to handle both.",
      "current_focus": "We're now prototyping a virtual try-on system using MediaPipe because we realized that seeing how a piece looks on your body is crucial for boutique shopping. This is especially important since shoppers can't physically try on items before purchasing.",
      "learning": "Building Threadress taught me that the best products emerge from deeply understanding both sides of a marketplace - the shoppers' frustrations and the retailers' operational constraints."

        "challenge": "Coordinating with 100+ influencers across TikTok and YouTube required meticulous organization. Each creator had different requirements, timelines, and content styles.",
        "solution": "I created a systematic outreach process with clear briefs, deadlines, and deliverables. This structure helped us maintain quality while scaling our reach.",

        "key_project": "Analyzing 900+ digital garments to quantify the environmental benefits was fascinating. We found that digital fashion reduces waste by 97% compared to physical production, but AI training still has a carbon footprint that needs to be considered.",
        "insight": "The Meta Digital Fashion Trends Report revealed that avatar economies are becoming real economies - people are spending real money on digital fashion, and brands need to take this seriously.",
        "platform_analysis": "Studying Roblox, Snapchat, Zepeto, and Bitmoji showed me that each platform has a unique fashion culture. Roblox is more gaming-focused, while Bitmoji is about personal expression. Understanding these nuances is crucial for brand partnerships."

      "technical_choice": "We chose n8n for orchestration because we needed to connect multiple LLM agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. The visual workflow made it easier to iterate during the hackathon.",
      "winning_factor": "The judges were impressed by our end-to-end design - we didn't just build a prototype, we thought through the entire user experience from event detection to actionable insights.",

Coming from Ukraine, I've seen how technology can transform economies and how important it is to build products that work across different markets and cultures."

The idea came from our own frustration - we'd spend hours searching for specific fashion items and find nothing. We realized that search engines prioritize sponsored content over genuine recommendations. With AI tools becoming more powerful, we saw an opportunity to build something that truly understands shopper intent and connects them with real boutique inventory."

        "answer": "DRESSX taught me how digital fashion companies operate. In my first summer, I learned about influencer marketing and creator partnerships at scale. In my second summer, I shifted to sustainability reporting, which showed me how to measure the environmental impact of digital products. I also learned how different platforms (Roblox, Snapchat, Bitmoji) have unique fashion cultures that brands need to understand."

        "question": "How did you transition from investment banking to tech?",
        "answer": "My internship at Dragon Capital gave me strong analytical and financial skills, but I realized I wanted to build products rather than just analyze them. The transition happened naturally - I started taking tech and product management courses, got involved in hackathons, and eventually started building Threadress. The analytical skills from IB are still valuable - I use them for market research, competitive analysis, and understanding business models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was your biggest challenge building Threadress?",
        "answer": "The biggest challenge was POS integration. We discovered that boutiques use either Square or Shopify, and each has different APIs and data structures. We had to design our system to be flexible enough to handle both while maintaining real-time inventory accuracy. This required extensive discovery calls with 50+ boutiques to understand their operational needs."

We used n8n to orchestrate LLM agents and MCP tools. What set us apart was our end-to-end design - we didn't just build a prototype, we thought through the entire user experience.

For Threadress, I learned what I needed as we built it - multimodal embeddings, vector databases, API integration. I'm not a computer science major, but I believe in learning by doing. When I need to build something, I figure out how to build it."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's your approach to learning new technologies?",
        "answer": "I learn best by building projects. When we needed to use MediaPipe for virtual try-on, I didn't just read documentation - I built a prototype. I also believe in 'vibe-coding' - finding the right environment and mindset that makes learning enjoyable. Whether that's with music, in a coffee shop, or late at night, I find what works for me."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you balance technical skills with business skills?",
        "answer": "I don't see them as separate. Technical skills help me understand what's possible and communicate with engineers. Business skills help me understand market needs and build products people want. The best product managers can speak both languages. For Threadress, I need to understand the technical implementation of our matching engine AND understand how boutiques operate their businesses."

When you search for 'flowy summer dress with floral pattern,' we use AI to understand your intent and show you actual in-stock items from local boutiques. We're bridging the gap between online search and in-store retail, helping boutiques get discovered while helping shoppers find exactly what they're looking for."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the product-matching engine work?",
        "answer": "We use multimodal embeddings to understand both text descriptions and visual features of garments. When a shopper searches, we convert their query into a vector embedding. We then search our vector database of boutique inventory to find the closest matches. This allows us to understand semantic meaning - 'flowy' and 'airy' are similar concepts, even if the exact words don't match."

        "question": "What's next for Threadress?",
        "answer": "We're currently prototyping a virtual try-on system using MediaPipe and body-landmark detection. This will let shoppers see how boutique pieces look on their body before purchasing. We're also expanding our boutique network and refining our POS integrations to support more retailers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's been the biggest learning from building Threadress?",
        "answer": "The biggest learning is that the best products emerge from deeply understanding both sides of a marketplace. We spent months talking to boutiques to understand their operational constraints before building anything. This discovery process shaped everything - from our POS integration strategy to our matching algorithm. You can't build a good marketplace product without understanding both the supply and demand sides."

  "industry_perspectives": {
    "fashion_tech": {
      "digital_fashion_trends": "Digital fashion is becoming a real economy. People are spending real money on virtual garments for their avatars. This isn't just a gaming trend - it's about self-expression and identity in digital spaces. Brands that ignore this are missing a huge opportunity, especially with Gen Z and Gen Alpha who are native to these platforms.",
      "sustainability": "Digital fashion has massive environmental benefits - 97% less waste compared to physical production. But we need to be honest about AI's carbon footprint. Training models and running inference still has environmental costs. The industry needs better tools to measure and reduce this impact.",
      "avatar_economies": "Each platform (Roblox, Snapchat, Zepeto, Bitmoji) has a unique fashion culture. Roblox is more gaming-focused, while Bitmoji is about personal expression. Brands need to understand these nuances to succeed. A one-size-fits-all approach won't work."
    },
    "retail_tech": {
      "boutique_discovery": "Small boutiques have beautiful, unique inventory but struggle with discoverability. They can't compete with large retailers on SEO or advertising spend. AI-powered search that understands intent can level the playing field, helping shoppers find exactly what they want while helping boutiques get discovered.",
      "real_time_inventory": "The future of retail is real-time inventory visibility. Shoppers want to know what's actually available, not what might be in stock. This requires deep POS integration and real-time data sync, which is technically challenging but essential for trust.",
      "virtual_try_on": "Virtual try-on is becoming table stakes for online fashion. But current solutions are mostly for large retailers. We need tools that work for smaller boutiques too, using accessible technology like MediaPipe rather than expensive 3D scanning systems."
    },
    "ai_ml": {
      "multimodal_ai": "The future of search is multimodal. Text-only search is limiting - fashion is visual. Multimodal embeddings that understand both text and images will transform how people discover products. This is especially powerful for fashion where style, color, and silhouette matter more than keywords.",
      "agentic_systems": "Multi-agent AI systems are more powerful than single large models. Specialized agents working together can produce better results - one agent detects events, another analyzes impacts, another provides recommendations. This is the architecture we used for NEXUS and it's the future of complex AI applications.",
      "vector_databases": "Vector databases are essential for semantic search. Traditional keyword search can't understand intent - 'flowy dress' and 'airy garment' should return similar results. Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning, making search much more intelligent.",
      "llm_agents": "LLM agents are becoming more practical with tools like n8n for orchestration and MCP (Model Context Protocol) for connecting different services. This makes it easier to build complex AI systems without being an ML engineer."
    },
    "product_management": {
      "user_research": "The best products come from deep user research. For Threadress, we talked to 50+ boutiques before building anything. This discovery process shaped our entire product strategy. You can't build a good product without understanding your users' actual problems and constraints.",
      "technical_pm": "Technical PMs who can code are becoming more valuable. You don't need to be a software engineer, but understanding how things are built helps you make better decisions, communicate with engineers, and build better products. My technical skills have been crucial for Threadress.",
      "marketplace_dynamics": "Building a marketplace requires understanding both sides. You can't optimize for one side at the expense of the other. For Threadress, we need to help shoppers find what they want AND help boutiques get discovered and make sales. This balance is critical."
    },
    "startup_ecosystem": {
      "accelerators": "Accelerators like Rise (Barclays) are valuable not just for funding but for structure and mentorship. The workshops on product-market fit, user research, and design thinking were incredibly helpful. But the real value is the network and the accountability - having deadlines and deliverables forces you to move faster.",
      "hackathons": "Hackathons are great for learning new technologies quickly and building something end-to-end. Winning the NYU Stern AI Fintech Hackathon validated our approach to multi-agent systems and gave us confidence in our technical abilities.",
      "co_founding": "Finding the right co-founder is crucial. Clara and I had been discussing building something together since freshman year, but we waited until we had the right idea, skills, and resources. The relationship matters more than rushing into something."

  "decision_making_frameworks": {
    "choosing_projects": {
      "framework": "I evaluate projects based on three criteria: 1) Does it solve a real problem I've experienced? 2) Do I have the skills (or can I learn them) to build it? 3) Is there a clear path to impact? Threadress checked all three boxes - we experienced the problem, we could learn the technical skills, and there was a clear path to helping both shoppers and boutiques.",
      "example": "When deciding whether to build Threadress, I asked: Have I personally struggled with this? Yes - hours searching for specific items. Can we build it? Yes - AI tools make it possible. Will it matter? Yes - both shoppers and boutiques need this. That clarity made the decision easy."
    },
    "technical_choices": {
      "framework": "I choose technologies based on: 1) What solves the problem best? 2) What can we learn and iterate quickly with? 3) What will scale if we succeed? For Threadress, we chose multimodal embeddings because they solve the semantic search problem. We chose vector databases because they're the right tool for the job. We're using MediaPipe for virtual try-on because it's accessible and doesn't require expensive 3D scanning.",
      "example": "When choosing between Square and Shopify integration, we didn't pick one - we designed our system to handle both. This was the right decision because boutiques use different systems, and we need to support both to succeed."
    },
    "career_decisions": {
      "framework": "I make career decisions based on: 1) Will I learn and grow? 2) Will I have impact? 3) Does it align with my values and interests? Moving from marketing to sustainability at DRESSX was about learning something new. Starting Threadress was about having impact. Choosing product management as a career path aligns with my interests in technology, business, and user experience.",
      "example": "When deciding to return to DRESSX for a second summer in a different role, I asked: Will I learn something new? Yes - sustainability reporting. Will it be valuable? Yes - understanding environmental impact is crucial. Does it interest me? Yes - I care about sustainability. The decision was clear."
    },
    "learning_priorities": {
      "framework": "I prioritize learning based on: 1) What do I need to build what I'm building? 2) What will be valuable long-term? 3) What am I excited about? I learned multimodal embeddings because we needed them for Threadress. I'm learning LLM agents because they're the future of AI applications. I'm always learning product management because it's my career path.",
      "example": "When we needed to build the virtual try-on system, I didn't know MediaPipe. But I learned it because we needed it, and I was excited about the technical challenge. Learning by building is my approach."
    },
    "problem_solving": {
      "framework": "When facing a problem, I: 1) Understand the root cause (not just symptoms), 2) Research how others have solved it, 3) Prototype a solution quickly, 4) Iterate based on feedback. For Threadress, the root problem wasn't 'bad search' - it was 'search engines prioritize sponsored content over user intent.' The solution wasn't 'better keywords' - it was 'AI that understands semantic meaning.'",
      "example": "When we struggled with POS integration, I didn't just pick one system. I talked to 50+ boutiques to understand the root cause - they use different systems. The solution was building flexibility into our architecture, not forcing them to use one system."
